# Sum-of-sister-clade-differences
This is a Repository of R Resources to assess taxonomic clustering in a phylogenetic tree, by considering each taxonomic group a binary trait and computing the sum of sister clade differences. 
I include here the R project file and the R script in a form of an .Rmd file, along with an R Markdown HTML file.

You can find the .html file if you follow this:
